Summary
The IAM Permissions Explorer is a design concept that helps cloud security engineers discover, analyze, and remediate excessive or unused IAM permissions. It provides a risk-based overview, detailed permission analysis, and a guided remediation workflow to reduce blast radius while minimizing operational risk.

Key Persona
- Role: Cloud Security Engineer
- Goals: Identify high-risk identities, review permission usage, and safely reduce excess permissions.

Three Core Screens
- Screen 1 — IAM Permissions Overview: Centralized dashboard with risk summary cards, search and filters, and an identities table to prioritize reviews.
- Screen 2 — Permission Details: Detailed view for a selected identity showing permission status (All, Excessive, Unused, Active), last used dates, and risk metadata.
- Screen 3 — Remediation Plan: Impact-aware remediation actions (Remove, Scope Down, Monitor) with draft/save controls and approvals.

Features (MVP)
- Risk-based IAM overview to surface high-risk users and roles.
- Detailed permission analysis with status filters and last-used metadata.
- Guided remediation with impact visibility and approval safeguards.

Success Metrics
- Reduction in excessive and unused permissions
- Time to identify and review high-risk identities
- Number of identities remediated per audit cycle
